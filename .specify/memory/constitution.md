# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Documentation Constitution

## Vision

To be the most accessible and practical guide for learning about physical AI and humanoid robotics, empowering beginners and intermediate learners through hands-on projects.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
All content must prioritize practical, hands-on examples and projects over purely theoretical discussions. The goal is to help readers build real things.

### II. Audience-Centric Content
Content must be clear, concise, and written specifically for a beginner to intermediate audience. Avoid jargon where possible and explain complex concepts in simple terms.

### III. Docusaurus as the Single Source of Truth
All documentation and published content will be created and managed within the Docusaurus framework to ensure consistency and a high-quality reading experience.

### IV. Community-Driven Improvement
The project is a living document. We actively encourage and rely on community feedback, suggestions, and contributions to improve the content iteratively.

## Success Criteria

- **Engagement:** Consistent growth in readership, time on page, and other key engagement metrics.
- **Feedback:** Overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community and high ratings on any associated learning platforms.
- **Contribution:** A growing number of meaningful contributions from the community, from typo fixes to new content modules.

## Constraints

- **Technical Stack:** All content must be compatible with and rendered correctly by the Docusaurus platform. No external publishing platforms are permitted.
- **Audience Level:** Content must not exceed an intermediate technical level to ensure it remains accessible to the target audience.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary:** Readers (Beginner to Intermediate Learners in AI and Robotics).
- **Secondary:** Authors, Editors, and Community Contributors.

## Brand Identity

- **Tone:** Educational, encouraging, and authoritative yet accessible.
- **Values:** Practicality, clarity, and a passion for sharing knowledge about robotics and AI.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and governance. All contributions and decisions must align with it. Amendments require a documented proposal and approval from project maintainers.
