# Development Plan: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `001-docusaurus-book-plan`
**Date**: 2025-12-07
**Spec**: `C:\Users\INTEL\Desktop\hackathon\specs\001-docusaurus-book-plan\spec.md`

## 1. Summary

This document outlines the development plan for creating the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book using Docusaurus. The plan covers the initial setup of the Docusaurus project, a phased approach for content development, and the file structure for the book's content, ensuring alignment with the project's constitution and specification.

## 2. Constitution Check

- [x] **Hands-On Learning First:** The plan is centered around developing hands-on, practical lessons.
- [x] **Audience-Centric:** Content development phases include specific review steps to ensure content is appropriate for the target audience.
- [x] **Docusaurus as the Standard:** The entire plan is based on using Docusaurus as the publishing platform.
- [x] **Community-Driven:** The plan includes a review phase with beta readers to incorporate community feedback early in the process.

## 3. Docusaurus Setup and Configuration

This section details the steps to set up the Docusaurus project.

### Step 1: Initialize Docusaurus Site

A new Docusaurus site will be created using the classic template.

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest docusaurus-book classic
```

This will create a new directory named `docusaurus-book` with the basic Docusaurus project structure.

### Step 2: Initial Configuration

The `docusaurus.config.js` file will be updated with the book's information.

```javascript
// docusaurus.config.js
module.exports = {
  title: 'Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics',
  tagline: 'A Hands-On Guide to Building and Programming Humanoid Robots',
  url: 'https://your-username.github.io', // TODO: Update with actual URL
  baseUrl: '/docusaurus-book/', // TODO: Update if using a custom domain
  projectName: 'docusaurus-book',
  organizationName: 'your-username', // TODO: Update with GitHub username
  // ... other configurations
};
```

### Step 3: Sidebar Configuration

The `sidebars.js` file will be configured to auto-generate the sidebar from the `docs` directory structure. This makes it easy to add new chapters and lessons.

```javascript
// sidebars.js
module.exports = {
  bookSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
};
```

## 4. Content Development Phases

The book will be developed in the following phases.

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 days)

- **Task 1**: Initialize the Docusaurus project as described above.
- **Task 2**: Configure `docusaurus.config.js` and `sidebars.js`.
- **Task 3**: Create the directory structure for Chapter 1 inside the `/docs` directory.
- **Task 4**: Create placeholder Markdown files for the three lessons in Chapter 1.

### Phase 2: Chapter 1 Content Creation (1-2 weeks)

- **Task 5**: Write the full content for **Lesson 1.1: Your First Bipedal Walker**. This includes the tutorial, images, diagrams, and code snippets.
- **Task 6**: Write the full content for **Lesson 1.2: Making it Move**.
- **Task 7**: Write the full content for **Lesson 1.3: Introduction to Walking Gaits**.

### Phase 3: Review and Refinement (1 week)

- **Task 8**: Conduct a full editorial review of Chapter 1 for clarity, consistency, and adherence to the lesson format.
- **Task 9**: Perform a technical review by testing all assembly instructions and code.
- **Task 10**: Share Chapter 1 with a small group of beta readers and incorporate their feedback.

### Phase 4: Expansion (Ongoing)

- **Task 11**: Plan and outline Chapter 2 (e.g., "Sensing the World").
- **Task 12**: Repeat the content creation and review process for all subsequent chapters.

## 5. Project and Content File Structure

The project will be housed in a `docusaurus-book` directory. The book content itself will be located within the `docusaurus-book/docs` directory.

### Docusaurus Project Structure

```
/docusaurus-book
├── blog/
├── docs/                 # Book content goes here
├── src/
│   └── css/
│   └── pages/
├── static/
├── docusaurus.config.js
├── sidebars.js
└── package.json
```

### Content File Structure (within `/docs`)

The content will be organized by chapters, with each chapter in its own directory.

```
/docs
└── foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/
    ├── _category_.json
    ├── 01-your-first-bipedal-walker.md
    ├── 02-making-it-move.md
    └── 03-introduction-to-walking-gaits.md
```
