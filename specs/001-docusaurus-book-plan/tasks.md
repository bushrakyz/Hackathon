# Tasks: Docusaurus Book

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-docusaurus-book-plan/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for Docusaurus.

- [ ] T001 Initialize Docusaurus project using `npx create-docusaurus@latest docusaurus-book classic`.
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure `docusaurus-book/docusaurus.config.js` with the book title, tagline, and repository information.
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure `docusaurus-book/sidebars.js` to use `autogenerated` sidebar.
- [ ] T004 Create chapter directory `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics`.
- [ ] T005 Create `_category_.json` file in `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics` to define the chapter label.

## Phase 2: Chapter 1 - Foundations of Humanoid Robotics (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Create the content for the first three lessons of the book.

**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus site can be built, and the first chapter with its three lessons is rendered correctly.

### Implementation for Chapter 1

- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Create placeholder file `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/01-your-first-bipedal-walker.md`.
- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Create placeholder file `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/02-making-it-move.md`.
- [ ] T008 [P] [US1] Create placeholder file `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/03-introduction-to-walking-gaits.md`.
- [ ] T009 [US1] Write content for Lesson 1.1 in `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/01-your-first-bipedal-walker.md` following the lesson format from the spec.
- [ ] T010 [US1] Write content for Lesson 1.2 in `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/02-making-it-move.md` following the lesson format from the spec.
- [ ] T011 [US1] Write content for Lesson 1.3 in `docusaurus-book/docs/foundations-of-humanoid-robotics/03-introduction-to-walking-gaits.md` following the lesson format from the spec.

## Phase 3: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple lessons.

- [ ] T012 Review and edit all content in Chapter 1 for clarity and technical accuracy.
- [ ] T013 Test all code snippets and assembly instructions for Chapter 1.
- [ ] T014 Gather feedback from beta readers for Chapter 1.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Must be completed before any content creation.
- **Chapter 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion. Tasks T009, T010, and T011 can be worked on in parallel after the placeholder files are created.
- **Polish (Phase 3)**: Depends on the completion of Chapter 1.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Chapter 1 Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup.
2.  Complete Phase 2: Chapter 1.
3.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Build the Docusaurus site and verify that Chapter 1 is complete and correct.
4.  Deploy a preview for beta readers.
